# Basic Demo Flask

A very very basic demo of how to use flask to handle submitted form data.

It isn't pretty. It isn't close to production ready, but it is a starting point for people to look at.

It uses Python 3 and the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework to introduce things.

## Running it

To start off, you will need python3 and pip installed. Then run

`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements in your environment

Then just run it with `python sample.py`
